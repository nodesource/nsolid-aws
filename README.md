## Getting Started with N|Solid on AWS

Easily run N|Solid in AWS using our [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates. You can find a list of templates and their descriptions in the [README.md](/templates/README.md). 

Follow these steps to use the CloudFormation templates in `aws-nsolid`:

1. Find the template you want to run in the `/templates` folder, then click the **Deploy to AWS** button.

2. This will open up CloudFormation in your own account. Click the **Next** button.

3. Fill in the required parameters and change the `Stack Name` if desired. Then click the **Next** button.

4. Adjust any CloudFormation options if desired. Click **Next**.

5. If the template requires IAM capabilities, you will need to check the "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names." box. Once you are ready, click the **Create** button.
